### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Use Python to understand U.S bikeshare data. Calculate statistics and build an interactive script where a user chooses the data from a dataset to analyze with the option of filter it.

In this project used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The code is written to import the data and answer interesting questions computing descriptive statistics creating an interactive experience between users and the terminal. The script allows users an option to get access to the raw data input.
You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
•	Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
•	End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
•	Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
•	Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
•	End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
•	User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
•	Gender
•	Birth Year

Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

### Statistics computed
#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

•	most common month
•	most common day of week
•	most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

•	most common start station
•	most common end station
•	most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

•	total travel time
•	average travel time

#4 User info
•	counts of each user type
•	counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
•	earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
